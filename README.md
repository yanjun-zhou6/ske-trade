# ske-2023Q2-trade-client

This is a project which created as I join SKE event in my company EPAM. A simple example of Trading system to practise EngX culture that's promoted by EPAM.

Based on the principle of minimal usage of framework, scaffold and library to complement with functional programming that utilizes the integration between `Rxjs` and WebSocket to keep up with `React`.

## git started

To start this project for development, please run commands as follow.

```sh
npm install

```

If you want to deploy for production, please run `npm build` to get the artifacts built.

## System target

[Trading Platform Application.docx](./doc/%5BCoding%20Test%5D%20Trading%20Platform%20Application.docx)

Split functionality into three parts according above document.

- Initially request trade list and show in a table
- Update trades and newly add trades
- Delete and highlight trades in context menu

Tech requirement

- Performance optimiaztion
- Table should run smoothly with 10000+ records
- High quality of code standard
- Unit test and integration test
- Typescript is prefered

[Trading system requirement](https://houbb.github.io/2020/06/19/system-design-how-to-design-trade-system-01-first-sight#%E4%BA%A4%E6%98%93%E7%B3%BB%E7%BB%9F%E9%9C%80%E6%B1%82)

Key points from above requirement blog

- high availability
- high performance
- high security (ignore)

Try to do a system which can be accessed in offline condition and with high performance. Based on this target, conduct tech selection as blow.

- `react` plays as a basic render layer.
- `react-table` as a table tool which is a `headless` UI library.
- `react-window` to fix long list Rendering issues.
- `react-window-infinite-loader` to support infiniting load.
- `servicework` to fix offline available issue with cache static resouces like js, css, etc.
- `indexDB` as a cache layer to keep site high performant and access in offline condition
- `rxjs` as a powerful tool to deal with stuff in async event case.
